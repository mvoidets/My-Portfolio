          <p>I’m currently a student in a Full Stack Development bootcamp, where I’m building my expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies. Through this program, I’ve gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more. I’m passionate about coding because it allows me to solve real-world problems and create intuitive, user-friendly applications.</p>

          <p>I thrive on continuous learning and am always excited to tackle new challenges. As I build my skills and gain more experience, I’m eager to contribute to a team that values growth, collaboration, and innovation. My goal is to bring my fresh knowledge and strong work ethic to a dynamic company, where I can keep growing while making a meaningful impact.</p>
